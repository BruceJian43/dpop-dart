# dpop-dart

A secure, pure Dart implementation of **RFC 9449: OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP)** at the application layer.

This library abstracts the complexity of cryptographic signing and header formatting, allowing Dart and Flutter developers to easily upgrade from standard Bearer tokens to DPoP-bound access tokens.
